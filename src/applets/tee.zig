//! `tee` -- DESIGN.md §1: `-a/--append`, `FILE...` (0+). Opens each FILE
//! `write|create|(append|trunc)`; an open failure prints `tee: {f}: {strerror}`, sets
//! rc=1, but tee CONTINUES with the rest. Reads stdin 8 KiB at a time and `writeAll`s
//! each chunk to stdout AND to every successfully-opened fd, best-effort (write errors
//! on any single fd -- including stdout -- are silently ignored, the loop keeps going
//! until stdin is exhausted). No `-i`, no `-p`.
